# Mission-to-Mars
## Overview
- The purpose of this project was to build an app to conduct web-scraping of MARS data and create an HTML page to show the results.

## Results
- Used Juypyter Notebook to scrape full resolution of Mars's Hemispheres alongside its and names from the site: https://marshemispheres.com/' and stored them into a dictionary that was then added to our APP so it was displayed on our HTML page.
- We then added some style to the page by stylizing the button to be smaller relative to the headline and also by making the featured image a circle to fit the theme of planetary data.

## Summary 
- Successfully created a page that aesthetically displays the data collected, is mobile-responsive and uses Bootstraps 3 components to style the webpage creating a user-friendly scraping tool.
